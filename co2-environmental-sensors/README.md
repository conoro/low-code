# CO2 and other Environmental Sensor data to Google Sheets and Telegram
This Story shows how to use Tines with IOT sensors and both Google Sheets and Telegram. 

The full write-up is over on my Tech blog at [conoroneill.net](https://conoroneill.net/2021/09/19/using-tines-for-home-iot-automation/)

In this directory you'll find:
* The [Arduino Code](https://github.com/conoro/tines-stories/tree/main/co2-environmental-sensors/Tines_BME680_MHZ19_SGP30_CCS811_Generic)
* [My slightly hacked version](https://github.com/conoro/tines-stories/raw/main/co2-environmental-sensors/Adafruit_Conor_CCS811.zip) of the Adafruit CCS811 library to work with ESP32
* [Detailed instructions](https://github.com/conoro/tines-stories/blob/main/co2-environmental-sensors/google_sheets_auth_on_tines.md) on connecting Google Sheets to Tines
* [The export](https://github.com/conoro/tines-stories/raw/main/co2-environmental-sensors/environmental-sensor-data-to-google-sheets-and-telegram.json) of the Tines Story in the blogpost above
